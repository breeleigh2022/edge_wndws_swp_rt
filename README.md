Automatic Swipe, Start &amp; Stop
This JavaScript code creates two buttons on a webpage, one for starting a clicker and one for stopping it. When the clicker is started, the code will simulate clicks on a specific button on the webpage at random intervals between 3 and 10 seconds. The clicking can be stopped at any time by clicking the "Stop" button.

Installation To use this code on the webpage, you can simply copy and paste the code into your console. If you want to change buttons, make sure to adjust the querySelector string to match the new button

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and modify the code to fit your specific needs.

Usage Once the code is pasted to your console, swipes will be automatic until you click 'Stop'
